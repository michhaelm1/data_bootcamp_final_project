Project Description:
Suicide rates has always been a huge concern between our group members and so, in this project, we dive into the correlations between suicide rate and a range of different factors based on a dataset provided on Kaggle. In hopes of finding which factors may most critically affect suicide rates, we created scatterplots, bar graphs, and line plots to graphically present trends and outliers we see in this dataset. Overall, we found that the factors age and gender plays a big part in influencing suicide rates, consequently providing us with a deeper statistical insight into suicidal prevention.
